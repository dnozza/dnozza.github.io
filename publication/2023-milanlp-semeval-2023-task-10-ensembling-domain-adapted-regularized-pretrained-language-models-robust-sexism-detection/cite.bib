    abstract = "We present the system proposed by the MilaNLP team for the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS) shared task.We propose an ensemble modeling approach to combine different classifiers trained with domain adaptation objectives and standard fine-tuning.Our results show that the ensemble is more robust than individual models and that regularized models generate more {``}conservative{''} predictions, mitigating the effects of lexical overfitting.However, our error analysis also finds that many of the misclassified instances are debatable, raising questions about the objective annotatability of hate speech data.",
