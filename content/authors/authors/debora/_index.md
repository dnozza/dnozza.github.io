**Debora Nozza** is an Assistant Professor in Computing Sciences at [Bocconi University](https:\\www.bocconi.it/). She was awarded a **€1.5m ERC Starting Grant project 2023** for research on personalized and subjective approaches to Natural Language Processing. Previously, she was awarded a €120,000 grant from Fondazione Cariplo for her project [MONICA](https://milanlproc.github.io/project/monitoring_italian_measures_response_covid19/), which focuses on monitoring coverage, attitudes, and accessibility of Italian measures in response to COVID-19. Her research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, specifically on the detection and counter-acting of hate speech and algorithmic bias on Social Media data in multilingual context.

She organized the [7th Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH)](https://www.workshopononlineabuse.com/) at ACL 2023 and the [ICWSM 2023 Data Challenge: Temporal social data](https://sites.google.com/view/icwsm2023datachallenge/home) at ICWSM 2023. She was one of the organizers of the task on Automatic Misogyny Identification (AMI) at [Evalita 2018](\url{http://www.evalita.it/2018}) and [Evalita 2020](\url{https://amievalita2020.github.io/}), and one of the organizers of the HatEval Task 5 at [SemEval 2019](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2019/) on multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter.
