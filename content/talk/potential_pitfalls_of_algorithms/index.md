abstract: "Algorithms have come to rule very sensitive aspects of our lives, but they are not always treating us all fairly. They might fail to understand us or even work against us, according to the guests of the 3rd episode of Clarity in a Messy World podcasts, Dirk Hovy and Debora Nozza.
If we are what we eat, algorithms are as good as what they are fed. To train an algorithm based on #machinelearning, you feed it with large amounts of data and let it learn by experience. If you feed it data that reflect societal stereotypes, the algorithm will replicate them."
