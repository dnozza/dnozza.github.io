# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Digital technologies have brought many benefits for society, transforming how people connect, communicate and interact with each other. However, they have also enabled abusive and harmful content such as
hate speech and harassment to reach large audiences, and for their negative effects to be amplified. The
sheer amount of content shared online means that abuse and harm can only be tackled at scale with the
help of computational tools. However, detecting and moderating online abuse and harms is a difficult
task, with many technical, social, legal and ethical challenges. The Workshop on Online Harms and
Abuse (WOAH) is the leading workshop dedicated to research addressing these challenges."
