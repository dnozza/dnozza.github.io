abstract: Modern social media have long been observed as a mirror for public discourse
  and opinions. Especially in the face of exceptional events, computational language
  tools are valuable for understanding public sentiment and reacting quickly. During
  the coronavirus pandemic, the Italian government issued a series of financial measures,
  each unique in target, requirements, and benefits. Despite the widespread dissemination
  of these measures, it is currently unclear how they were perceived and whether they
  ultimately achieved their goal.In this paper, we document the collection and release
  of MONICA, a new social media dataset for MONItoring Coverage and Attitudes to such
  measures. Data include approximately ten thousand posts discussing a variety of
  measures in ten months. We collected annotations for sentiment, emotion, irony,
  and topics for each post. We conducted an extensive analysis using computational
  models to learn these aspects from text. We release a compliant version of the dataset
  to foster future research on computational approaches for understanding public opinion
  about government measures. We will release the data at URL.
