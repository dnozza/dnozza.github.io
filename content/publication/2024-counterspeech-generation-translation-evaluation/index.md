abstract: 'We describe our participation in the Multilingual Counterspeech Generation
  shared task, which aims to generate a counternarrative to counteract hate speech,
  given a hateful sentence and relevant background knowledge. Our team tested two
  different aspects: translating outputs from English vs generating outputs in the
  original languages and filtering pieces of the background knowledge provided vs
  including all the background knowledge. Our experiments show that filtering the
  background knowledge in the same prompt and leaving data in the original languages
  leads to more adherent counternarrative generations, except for Basque, where translating
  the output from English and filtering the background knowledge in a separate prompt
  yields better results. Our system ranked first in English, Italian, and Spanish
  and fourth in Basque.'
